The good old days




I have personal Amazon packages delivered to Viasat all the time so they don't sit unattended on my front porch at home.  Just use this address:
     Viasat, Inc.
      Attn: <Employee Name>
      2426 Town Garden Rd
      Carlsbad, CA 92009
The campus mail delivery folks will drop it off at your office upon receipt.  Super easy!
